If I remember correctly, all sounds are licensed under CC0 and came from 
this collection: 
https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style

Font is romulus by pix3m, licensed under CC-BY 3.0 and downloaded from there:

All sprites were made by myself, moonburnt - and, for the time being, are to 
be used only in WeirdLand. However, if you are interested - just let me know 
and I may re-license them (I just don't see any point right now).
